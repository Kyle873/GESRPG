Goldeneye: Source RPG Gamemode
==============================

I originally started developing this gamemode a couple months ago and it's pretty near complete. It includes things such as:

* XP and leveling up via killing other players
* Money and cycling shop system allowing you to buy weapons outside the ones specified within map spawns
* Random events such as a Loot Briefcase which players would fight over, whoever help it would continuously get money
* Different money kill bonuses for things such as distance, weapon used, streak, etc.
* Upgradable stats

The final step in the process was balancing, but I eventually lost interest when the GES API started getting in the way and eventually stopped working on the project.
